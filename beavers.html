            <h2><b>Who are Beavers?</b></h2>
            <p>Beavers are people who:
                <li>Master new skills and try new things</li>
                <li>Have fun and go on adventures</li>
                <li>Make friends</li>
                <li>Are curious about the world around them</li>
                <li>Help others and make a difference, on their own doorstops and beyond</li><br><br>
                Every week, they gather in groups called Beaver Colonies to hop, skip and jump their way through lots of different games and activities - achieving anything they set their minds to, and having lots of fun along the way. <br><br>
                <h2><b>What do Beavers get up to?</b></h2>
                Being a Beaver is all about growing and learning in small but mighty ways. Here are some of the things you'll get up to with your new friends.

            <h2><b>Exploring the Great Outdoors</b></h2>
            <p>You'll spend lots of time outside with your Colony. Together, you might build a den, or go on a trip to the seaside, or host a Beaver sleepover beneath the stars. And even though you might not be ready to climb Mount Everest just yet, you’re guaranteed to have plenty of adventures on your own doorstop, because being a Beaver is all about making the most of what you have, wherever and whoever you are.</p><br><br>
            <h2><b>Trying new activities and learning new things</b></h2>
            <p>Going to Beavers is very different from going to school. Instead of learning from books, you'll figure the world out by exploring, playing and doing. <br><br>
                The most important skills you'll learn at Beavers are the ones that will make you feel super strong standing on your own two feet. We call these character skills. They include things like integrity – which means being honest and doing what you think is right – and initiative – which means knowing how to take the lead on something without being asked. It’s all about having the courage to try new things and learn from them.
