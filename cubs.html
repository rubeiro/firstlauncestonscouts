            <h2><b>Who are Cubs?</b></h2>
            <p>Cubs are young people aged 8 to 10½ who:
                <li>Master new skills and try new things</li>
                <li>Have fun and go on adventures</li>
                <li>Make friends</li>
                <li>Are curious about the world around them</li>
                <li>Help others and make a difference, on their own doorstops and beyond</li><br><br>
                Every week, they gather in groups called Cub Packs to take part in lots of interesting and challenging activities - achieving anything they set their minds to, and having lots of fun along the way. <br><br>
                <h2><b>What do Cubs get up to?</b></h2>
                Being a Cub is all about growing and learning in small but mighty ways. Below are some of the things you'll get up to with your new friends.

            <h2><b>Going on adventures</b></h2>
            <p>Race down a river. Tell stories by torchlight. Fall asleep beneath the stars. Alongside your Pack, you'll spend plenty of time in the great outdoors. Together, you might build a den in your local park, or create an edible raft out of sweets, or go on a moonlit hike through your home town. And even though you might not be ready to climb Mount Everest just yet, you're guaranteed to have plenty of adventures on your own doorstop, because being a Cub is all about making the most of what you have, wherever and whoever you are.</p><br><br>
            <h2><b>Learning new skills</b></h2>
            <p>Cubs learn by doing, and so will you. Some of the skills you develop will be practical, like knowing how to cook a delicious meal or give someone first aid. Others will allow you to become a master at your chosen hobby, or help you to succeed in whichever job you decide to do when you grow up. But the most important skills you'll learn at Cubs are the ones that will make you feel confident and happy in your own skin. We call these character skills, and they include things like integrity - which means being honest and doing what you think is right - and initiative - which means knowing how to take the lead on something without being asked.
                <br><br> Whatever skills you'd like to learn, it's all about having the courage to try new things and learn from them
